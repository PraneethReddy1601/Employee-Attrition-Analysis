## Project Overview

Employee attrition is a common issue in many organizations. Understanding and predicting employee turnover can help companies improve retention rates, optimize hiring strategies, and reduce costs associated with hiring and training new employees. This project aims to explore factors leading to employee attrition and build predictive models to identify employees at risk of leaving.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is [Employee Attrition Data] sourced from (mention the source here if applicable). It contains various employee attributes such as `Job Title`, `Job Experience`, `Key Skills`, `Role Category`, `Location`, `Functional Area`, `Industry`, `Role`, `Longitude`, `Latitude`, and `Salary`.

## Requirements

Install the following libraries to run the project:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains the employee attrition data file.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebook files for data analysis, preprocessing, and modeling.
- **src/**: Python scripts for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.
  
## Data Preprocessing

1. **Loading the Dataset**: The data is loaded from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
   
2. **Handling Missing Values**: Rows with missing values are removed.
   
3. **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Using Label Encoding to convert categorical variables into numerical format.
   
4. **Scaling Numeric Variables**: Standardizing numeric columns to a common scale using `StandardScaler`.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA aims to understand the data distribution, correlations, and relationships. The following analyses were performed:

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summary statistics of all variables.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Analyzing correlations to identify potential features impacting attrition.
- **Visualization**: Various plots (e.g., bar, box, histograms) to visualize the distribution and relationships of features with attrition.

## Modeling and Prediction

Multiple models were trained to predict employee attrition:

1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Random Forest Classifier**
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning** using GridSearchCV for the best model performance.

Model evaluation metrics include:

- **Accuracy Score**: To measure model correctness.
- **Confusion Matrix**: To visualize prediction accuracy and misclassification.
- **ROC AUC Score**: To assess the classification model performance.

## Results

Summarize the results, including the final model's accuracy, best hyperparameters, and insights on features most associated with employee attrition.

## Conclusion

The project demonstrated that certain employee features significantly impact attrition. By predicting attrition, HR departments can take preventative actions to reduce employee turnover and improve satisfaction.

## Future Improvements

1. **Feature Engineering**: Add more features that could impact attrition.
2. **Advanced Models**: Implementing more sophisticated algorithms such as XGBoost.
3. **Further Analysis**: Detailed EDA on high-impact features for actionable insights.
